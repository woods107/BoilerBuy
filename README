Description
-------------
It is not too difficult to find a local buy/sell/trade group on social
media sites such as Facebook, but what do you do if you don't have an
account yourself, of if there are multiple pages for your area?

The idea behind BoilerBuy is to provide a central location for people
who are looking to sell, while also making it easier for buyers to sift
through postings. It will have a simple account system to keep track of
who made a posting and their provided contact information, and simple
searching/sorting of available entries, while periodically removing
old postings.

NOTES
------
1. Run 'sudo pip install flask-sqlalchemy'
  -Run 'sudo pip install flask-migrate'
    - these are necessary for db work
2. Run 'flask db init' in venv
  - this sets up migration directories
